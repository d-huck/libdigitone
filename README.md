# libdigitone

This library is intended to interface with the Elektron Digitone and convert the sysex dumps into meaningful data. It is 
currently in development and not intended for use at the moment. Information on the research done to build this library 
can be found in the attached [Jupyter Notebook](https://gitlab.com/dhuck/libdigitone/blob/production/doc/digitoner.ipynb).

### Legal and Acknowledgments

The only relation to Elektron here is the fact that I purchased some of their gear and loved it enough to make a project 
like this. I do not work and do not plan (but there's always hope) to work for Elektron anytime. This library is and will 
remain a labor of love. 

I would like to acknowledge the great work done over at [libanalogrytm](https://github.com/bsp2/libanalogrytm), which 
has given me a giant leg up on this endeavor. Also, the fine people who answered when I asked the preliminary 
[questions about this project](https://www.elektronauts.com/t/decoding-the-digitone-sysex/62731). I would have become
frustrated and given up long ago without the people in that thread who pointed me in the right direction.
